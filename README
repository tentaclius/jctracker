Simple MIDI tracker for Jack audio engine.
Currently in early development. More features pending.
Reads standard input for commands and notes to play, sends the corresponding MIDI events to
the specified port.

To compile the program you will need the following packages: g++, make, libjack-jackd2-dev (Jack Audio development files).
The binary file available in the repository is built on Ubuntu 16.04.1.

The following lines illustrate the valid commands.


         ; Comment line. Empty lines does not make a pause in the playback.
A5       ; The note A of fifth octave.
C        ; The note C of default (fourth) octave.
c        ; The same note; parser is case insensitive to notes.
C#       ; C sharp.
Bb       ; B flat.
B&       ; Another way of saying B-flat.
A#7      ; A shart of 7th octave.

C!40     ; Specify the velocity of the note (0..64).
C%20     ; Delay before the note plays in microseconds.
C@100    ; Note playing time in microseconds.
C%20@200!64    ; All modifiers together. The order does not matter.
c:1/2    ; 1/2 of the note length.
c:4+1/2  ; Note plyaing time is 4/2, start delay is 1/2 of the current note size.
         ; If both "@" and ":" delays are given, the delaying time is the sum of the two.
         ; All time modifiers can be real numbers.

C E G    ; Play several notes simultaneously.
         ; There are three columns, you can manage what port/channel each column
         ; belongs to by using "port" (see below).
(C E) G  ; Group first two notes, so both events associated with the first column.

.        ; Skip a turn. A silent note.
*        ; Play a default note. The default note is set by "default" command.
^        ; Repeat the last note.

C        ; Start the note...
|        ; ... and keep playing it while the "|" sign appears in the pattern.
|        ; ...

;; Full note format:
; <NoteName> [(#|b|&|n)] [<OctaveNumber>] [<Modifiers>]
;   where <Modifiers> contain one or several of the following (order is not important):
; !<IntegerNumber>      ; set the note's velocity;
; %<RealNumber>         ; delay the note for specified number of microseconds;
; @<RealNumber>         ; note playing time in microseconds;
; :<RealNumber>         ; note playing time in current note size parts;
; +<RealNumber>         ; delay the note in current note size parts;
; /<RealNumber>         ; specify the parts devisor for "+" and ":" modifiers.

;; Controlling directives.
default C#4    ; Set the default note (directive are case sensitive).
volume 50      ; Set the default volume for the notes (0..64).
transpose 10   ; Transpose the notes.
tempo 120      ; Set the playing speed in BPM.

loop 4         ; Play the block for n times.
c e g          ; If the number of repititions is not specified, the loop will go forever.
d f a

endloop

;; Bar separator.
-------        ; Visual bar separator. The number of '-' signs does not matter.
----- 3/4      ; You can set the quantization for the following blocks.
               ; Currently only the nominator is important. It defines how many notes will fit into the next cycle.
--- 4/4 #C     ; Specify the size and default signs.
--- #A bB nC   ; A-shart, B-flat, natural C.
Bn             ; "n" suffix to play natural tone.

alias drum C#2 ; Create an alias for the note.

;; Keep in mind that transpose, default, volume and alias modifiers are static, i.e. 
loop
c              ; Natural C will be played for all iterations.
--- #c         ; The signature change only applies to the notes after it.
c              ; Sharp C for all iterations.
endloop
;; The commands are applied at interpretation stage and affects the pattern directly.

;; tempo and --- (separator that also controls the quantization and signs) commands are dynamic.
;; I.e. in the following example the tempo will change in the middle of the iteration and will stay changed.

;; Note groups
(A B) C        ; Notes A and B will be sent to the channel associated with the first column. C to second column.

;; MIDI controllers
; $<ControllerNumber>=<IntegerValue 0..127>[..<FinalValue>:<Time>[/<Factor>]]
$4=100         ; Send the value 100 to the MIDI controller #4.
(C $4=100)     ; MIDI controls can be grouped with the notes and are being sent to the corresponding channel.
$7=0..127:3/2  ; Create a ramp of MIDI control messages. Change from 0 to 127 within 3/2 of current note time.
